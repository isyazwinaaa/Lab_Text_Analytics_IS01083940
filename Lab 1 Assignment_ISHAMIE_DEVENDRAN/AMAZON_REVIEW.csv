Ryan Burns,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2025","Very legit. Package showed up wrapped and carefully packaged. The negative reviews due to packs being ripped open are probably taking place during the logistics process and should not reflect on the seller. i got a top pick (espeon ex), a hyper rare, and a few masterball reverse holos. i bought another already!"
sher,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2025","This was the best Pok√©mon pack I ever opened, it‚Äôs expensive but so worth it! $128 for $1000+ in Pok√©mon cards. Highly recommend best boater box ever"
Andrew,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2025","I‚Äôve ordered 3 of these boxes in total now. First 2 were great got some good pulls and other cool holos and such. This 3rd box tho came opened up all the packs were rubber banded together, and the bottom of each pack was clearly cut off and missing. I was greatly disappointed receiving this."
Blossoming Cosplay,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2025","Definitely legitimate, came fully sealed and untampered with. I got a pretty good haul overall; essentially one hit per pack! None of the coveted eevee full illustrations, but a super cool Iron Valiant! It was worth the snag, especially as the price wasn't unreasonable. If you can't find the set in English, this is a great alternative!"
Bruno Russo,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2025","bought this from *lastsamurai. and got a Demi Godpack with 3 SAR, 6 Pokeball Pattern cards and one normal dreepy! amazing!"
Gremlin,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2025","Do to the insanity of PE (American) series we helped support our local family owned shop. Do to prices. Trainer box and binder to see if the pulls were as bad as first witnessed. Pulls were bad. So we started doing some research. Decided to purchase two boxes of this series (Japanese) instead. We pulled some great additions to our collection. Including a full art.
Looked at current going price. Found two more boxes from another seller and decided well this might be the last chance we get at this price let‚Äôs go for it and all went better than could have imagined.

There are more hits with the Japanese packs than the American if you are unfamiliar with them. The EX cards are meant to be played with so there are many you can end up with 4-5 plus. The rare cards are still rare. You can spend a lot of money and still never pull some of them.
If you do choose to take the risk and freak out over some of your pulls do not rip one of your full arts. If you manage to have a dup bulk card you can (however never recommend) do the ink test. Do some research, American and Japanese cards differ when verifying authenticity. The ink test for one is not the same as the other. Also know what you are looking at. Lots of counterfeit boxes.

Please remember to check the sellers feed back.
We have had a lot of luck with items shipped from our local Amazon distribution centers and ordering from Companies with a 98 plus rating with money back guarantee.

Hope this helps the Community.
Make it a wonderful day!"
Jessie,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2025","I've ordered 5 boxes in total on 2 different occasions. Delivery was fast and nothing was damaged or tampered with. Got at least my guaranteed SAR in every box, a couple boxes had more than 1. No SAR Umbreon but I did just pull the master ball umbrean and SAR Evee. Couldn't be happier with the seller. Likely will buy again in the future."
Byron R Claflin,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2025","Package was ripped and then taped back together like someone opened it, the box was smashed and some of the cards were bent, which not to happy about which is why I'm m giving it three stars,other than that cards are legit and cam factory sealed and did get some cool cards. the Japanese cards are so much higher quality then English cards plus each vox comes with at least one SAR pre box, I've totally switched to Japanese cards, wish i would have brought more boxes when they were 70 a box not 125, still worth the money plus shipping was overnight."

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2025","This product is amazing! Even with the ex pull each pack, you are guaranteed an SAR as well, with the chance of Demi and full on god packs! I was lucky enough to pull a god pack with all the eeveelution SAR‚Äôs on my last pack, this is definitely not a scam!"

jg267,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2025","Writing on behalf of my son, who ordered this with holiday money: all the cards were really nice and each pack had a hit! There were 10 cards per pack, and we got many eevee evolutions."

Mark Simmons,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2025",Thank you! Was fun to open and got some nice cards !
Brad,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025","Paid $300 for 3 booster boxes through cavegamers and didn't get any cards that will remotely get me any of my money back, not even a small percentage. I got offered on trade at a local card store that does good pricing a measly $2 for in store credit. $2 people. Nobody wants Japanese cards like the popular Youtubers are making it out to be. Admittedly I got 2 masterball Pok√©mon but even a grade 10 on both may only recover $150, -$50 just to risk grading them"

glaceaux,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2025","Overpriced but legit and got some great cards. The video of the guy ripping the card and saying its fake any full holo card will do that, there is a film on top of the card."
